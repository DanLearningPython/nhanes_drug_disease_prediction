## NHANES - Making predictions based off of health data using machine learning

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm

This data set contains a large variety of data from thousands of individuals about topics including: 
- Demographics - https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/DEMO_H.htm
- Medical conditions - https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/MCQ_H.htm
- Medications - https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/RXQ_RX_H.htm

We will first create a model to predict an individual's medical conditions given the drugs they take. Then, we will try to improve the model by adding in demographics. Refer to the links next to the topics for column descriptions.
